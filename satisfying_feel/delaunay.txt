cBasic Bowyer-Watson pseudocode

Time complexity O(n**2)

Ways of improving efficiency:

* The triangle connectivity can be used to locate the triangles which contain the new point in their circumcircle without having to check all the triangles 
thus decreasing time complexity to O(n log n).

* Pre-computing the circumcircles can save time at the expense of additional memory usage.

* If the points are uniformly distributed, sorting them along a space filling Hilbert curve prior to insertion can also speed point location.

function BowyerWatson(pointList) // pointList is a set of coordinates defining the points to be triangulated

  triangulation := empty triangle mesh data structure

  add super-triangle to triangulation // must be large enough to completely contain all the point in pointList

  for each point in pointList do // add all the points one at a time to the triangulation

    badTriangles := empty set

    for each triangle in triangulation do // first find all the triangles that are no longer valid due to the insertion

      if point is inside circumcircle of triangle add triangle to bad triangles

    polygon := empty set

    for each triangle in badTriangles do // find the boundary of the polygonal hole

      for each edge in triangle do 

        if edge is not shared by any other triangles in bad triangles

        add edge to polygon

    for each triangle in bad triangles do // remove them from the data structure
      
      remove triangle from triangulation

    for each edge in polygon do // re-triangulate the polygonal hole

      newTri := form a triangle from edge to point

      add newTri to triangulation      
      
  for each triangle in triangulation // done inserting points, now clean up

    if triangle contains a vertex from original super-triangle

      remove triangle from triangulation

  return triangulation
